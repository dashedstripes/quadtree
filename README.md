# Quadtree

A quadtree implementation in Javascript. Based on this [Tutorial.](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-use-quadtrees-to-detect-likely-collisions-in-2d-space--gamedev-374)

## Uses

I've written this class for use with 2D collision detection in order for an object to find it's nearest neighbours. I've intentionally not refactored the code as I think it helps understanding.
